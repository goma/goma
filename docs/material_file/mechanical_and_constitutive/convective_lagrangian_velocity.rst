   Convective Lagrangian Velocity = {model_name} {float_list} [L/t]

-----------------------
**Description / Usage**
-----------------------

In solid mechanics, when the deformation of the mesh is Lagrangian, i.e., motion of the
solid can be described by a mapping from the stress-free state (undeformed state) to the
deformed state, it is often desirable to prescribe a convective velocity of the stress-free
state that can lead to inertial forces through deformation (see Technical Discussion
below). This required card allows for the specification of solid-body translation or
rotation of the stress-free state, and results in an inertial term on the otherwise quasi
static solid momentum equation.

Definitions of the input parameters are as follows:

+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|{model_name} |Name of the prescribed velocity model. This parameter can have one of the following    |
|             |values: **NONE**, **CONSTANT**, or **ROTATIONAL**.                                     |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|{float_list} |One or more floating point numbers (<float1> through <floatn>) whose values are        |
|             |determined by the selection for {model_name}. These are identified in the discussion of|
|             |each model below. Note that not all models employ a {float_list}.                      |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Thus,

+--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
|**NONE**                                          |the stress-free state is assumed to be unmoving. No      |
|                                                  |floating point input values are required with this model.|
+--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
|**CONSTANT** <float1> <float2> <float3>           |the stress-free state is one of solid-body translation,  |
|                                                  |viz. it moves uniformly with a velocity specified by     |
|                                                  |three orthogonal components:                             |
|                                                  |                                                         |
|                                                  | * <float1> - X-component of velocity                    |
|                                                  | * <float2> - Y-component of velocity                    |
|                                                  | * <float3> - Z-component of velocity (for 3-D)          |
+--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
|**ROTATIONAL** <float1> <float2> <float3> <float4>|the stress-free state is one of solid-body rotation at a |
|                                                  |specified rotation rate.                                 |
|                                                  |                                                         |
|                                                  | * <float1> - Rotation rate, in radians/sec.             |
|                                                  | * <float2> - X-position of axis of rotation (must be    |
|                                                  |   constant in 3D).                                      |
|                                                  | * <float3> - Y-position of axis of rotation (must be    |
|                                                  |   constant in 3D, viz. the axis must be perpendicular to|
|                                                  |   both the X and Y axes, viz. the axis must be the Z    |
|                                                  |   axis.                                                 |
|                                                  | * <float4> - Set to zero. Parameter is not used for now.|
|                                                  |                                                         |
|                                                  |Note that this model is applicable in 2-D and certain 3-D|
|                                                  |problems in which the rotation axis is the Z-axis. To    |

|                                                  |input will require a point and a direction of the        |
|                                                  |rotation axis. In two-dimensions, the axis of rotation   |
|                                                  |is the Z-direction.                                      |

**Examples**
------------

The following is a sample input card:

::

   Convective Lagrangian Velocity = ROTATIONAL 25.0 1. 1. 0.

This card is associated with a material file, and hence a material that is of
*LAGRANGIAN* or *TOTAL_ALE* type (see *Mesh Motion* card). That materialâ€™s stressfree
state, as specified by this model, will rotate about an axis that is located at [1.0,
1.0, 0] at 25 radians/sec (assuming seconds are the time scale of the problem).

**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

This capability is often used when problems require a force or a boundary condition to
be applied to a solid material that is moving relative to the source, or the desired frame
of reference. Such constraints arise mainly in fluid-structure interaction problems
where one solid material is moving relative to another, with a fluid material in between,
e.g. deformable blade or knife metering/pushing liquid over a flat or round substrate.
These models have also been used in porous-material translation relative to a drying
source (see references below).

Specification of any model but **NONE** on this card produces the left-hand-side term in
the equation for quasi static equilibrium:

.. figure:: /figures/358_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

:math:`\sigma` is the Cauchy stress tensor of the solid material, and f is the body force per unit
volume. The first term is a result of the specified advection of the stress-free state. :math:`v_m^0`,
which depends solely on the user-prescribed velocity and the current state of
deformation, is by definition

.. figure:: /figures/359_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

where :math:`F_m` is the material deformation gradient tensor (computed somewhat differently
depending on the formulation, as described in the references below), and :math:`v_sfs` is the
stress-free state velocity field specified by this card.
