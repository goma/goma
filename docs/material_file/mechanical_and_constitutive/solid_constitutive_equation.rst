**Description / Usage**
-----------------------

This required card specifies the constitutive equation used to control mesh motion and/
or the constitutive model describing solid material stress response to deformation. The
single input parameter is defined as

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|{model_name}|The name of the constitutive equation. The permissible values for {model_name} are     |
|            |dependent on the selection for the Mesh Motion type, that being one of ARBITRARY,      |
|            |LAGRANGIAN/DYNAMIC_LAGRANGIAN, or TOTAL_ALE.                                           |
|            |                                                                                       |
|            |For an ARBITRARY *Mesh Motion*, {model_name} can be one of the following:              |
|            |                                                                                       |
|            | * **LINEAR** - a linear elastic model for which the deformations are assumed to be    |
|            |   small, thus simplifying the analysis of strain and stress.                          |
|            | * **NONLINEAR** - a nonlinear neo-Hookean elastic model for which the deformations can|
|            |   be large without loss of frame invariance. This is the recommended model (and all   |
|            |   materials currently default to NONLINEAR if the mesh is arbitrary).                 |
|            | * **ELLIPTIC** - elliptic mesh generation equations                                   |
|            |                                                                                       |
|            |For a LAGRANGIAN, DYNAMIC_LAGRANGIAN, or TOTAL_ALE *Mesh Motion*, {model_name} can be  |
|            |one of the following:                                                                  |
|            |                                                                                       |
|            | * **LINEAR** - a linear elastic model for which the deformations are assumed to be    |
|            |   small, thus simplifying the analysis of strain and stress.                          |
|            | * **NONLINEAR** - a nonlinear neo-Hookean model applicable for 2D, 3D, and CYLINDRICAL|
|            |   coordinates.                                                                        |
|            | * **HOOKEAN_PSTRAIN** - a nonlinear neo-Hookean model with plane strain for which the |
|            |   deformations can be large without loss of frame invariance (2D only).               |
|            | * **HOOKEAN_PSTRESS** - a nonlinear neo-Hookean model with plane stress (not activated|

|            | * **INCOMP_PSTRAIN** - An incompressible nonlinear neo-Hookean model with plane strain|
|            |   and a Lagrangian pressure constraint on the volume.                                 |
|            | * **INCOMP_PSTRESS** - An incompressible nonlinear neo-Hookean model with plane stress|
|            |   and a Lagrangian pressure constraint on the volume (not activated in *Goma* 4.0).   |
|            | * **INCOMP_3D** - Incompressible version of the neo-Hookean solid in a special        |
|            |   Segalman formulation that removes the volume-change from the strain tensor (like the|
|            |   *INCOMP_PSTRAIN* model above), and is specifically designed for 3D applications (not|
|            |   widely used).                                                                       |

The functional form of each of these equations is provided in the Technical Discussion
with some important details.

**Examples**
------------

The following is a sample input card:
::

   Solid Constitutive Equation = LINEAR

This equation type requires two elastic constants be specified, *Lame Lambda* and *Lame
Mu*. This constitutive equation can be used for all *Mesh Motion* types. It is not
recommended for large mesh deformations, even for ALE problems, because of
spurious stresses generated by solid body translation or rotation.


-------------------------
**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

The general compressible form of Hooke’s Law, which applies to the *LINEAR,
NONLINEAR* and *HOOKEAN_PSTRAIN* options, can be written as

.. figure:: /figures/348_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

Here :math:`\lambda` is the Lame coefficient for volume expansion, :math:`\varepsilon` is the volume strain measure
whose definition depends on the model chosen, :math:`\mu` is another elastic Lame coefficient
for shear deformation, :math:`\underline {E}` and is the chosen strain tensor, the form of which also
depends on the constitutive model chosen.

The general incompressible form of Hooke’s Law, which applies to all *INCOMP**
options, can be written as:

.. figure:: /figures/349_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

with *p* being the solid phase pressure. An additional continuity equation is required in
this case to account for the pressure (see *Continuity* equation card). Note, for these
model options one must set the *Lame LAMBDA* coefficient to zero, or the pressure term
and the expansion term are added together.

The volume change and strain tensors depend on the chosen solid constitutive equation
and are as follows: 

For the *LINEAR* option:

.. figure:: /figures/350_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

and

.. figure:: /figures/351_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

where :math:`\underline {d}` is the displacement field vector, tr is the tensor trace operator, and the gradient operator (:math:`\Delta`) is with respect to the deformed coordinates.

For all *NONLINEAR* models, we use the deformation gradient tensor as a building
block:

.. figure:: /figures/352_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

The “material coordinates” are :math:`\underline {X}` and describe the original locations of all parcels of material in the domain; and the “current configuration/spatial coordinates” 
:math:`\underline {x}` are the deformed mesh coordinates. Of course we have

.. figure:: /figures/353_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

for all *LAGRANGIAN* mesh motion cases. We define a Cauchy-Green tensor as:

.. figure:: /figures/354_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

and invoke the linearized small strain theory (viz. that :math:`\Delta_x` :math:`\underline{d}` 
:math:`\equiv` :math:`\Delta_x` :math:`\underline {d}`), and write

.. figure:: /figures/355_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

With these quantities, we form the volume strain and strain tensor for the various
models:

For *NONLINEAR, INCOMP_PSTRAIN, INCOMP_3D,* and *HOOKEAN_PSTRAIN*:

.. figure:: /figures/356_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

For *INCOMP_PSTRAIN* and *INCOMP_3D* we use:

.. figure:: /figures/357_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

For all other models we use :math:`\underline {E}` = :math:`\underline {C}`. It is noteworthy that we use the linearized small strain theory for parts of the strain tensor, but the real Lagrangian deformation gradient for the volumetric strain. For elastoviscoplastic models and *TOTAL_ALE* solid mechanics, we do not invoke the linearized small strain theory.

Also noteworthy is that the elastic constants :math:`\lambda` and :math:`\mu` are related to the more well known bulk and Young’s moduli and the Poisson’s ratio by simple expressions (see
*Lame Mu* and *Lame Lambda* cards).

----------
**Theory**
----------

The incompressible options (i.e., INCOMP_PSTRAIN and INCOMP_PSTRESS
and INCOMP_3D) use the theory of Segalman, et. al. (1992) to control mesh motion
and couple the volume dilation to changes in solvent content. Plane strain implies that
there is no deformation in the z-direction; plane stress implies there is no stress change
in the z-direction.
