::

	Streamwise normal stress = {yes | no}

-----------------------
**Description / Usage**
-----------------------

The stream-wise normal stress, :math:`T_{tt}`, is defined as tt: :math:`\tau`, where t is the unit tangent vector
to the streamlines computed as v ‚ÅÑ :math:`\mid` v :math:`\mid` and :math:`\tau` is the deviatoric part of the dissipative stress
tensor,

associated with the Navier-Stokes equations. This variable is called SNS in the output
EXODUS II file.

The permissible values for this postprocessing option are

======== ===============================================
**yes**  Calculate the stream-wise normal stress.
**no**   Do not calculate the stream-wise normal stress.

**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

As of 2/9/02 this function is computed with the based viscosity, and not the strain-rate
dependent viscosity as might be the case for viscosity models other than *NEWTONIAN*
(see *Viscosity* card).
