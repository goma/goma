::

   Viscosity = {yes | no}

-----------------------
**Description / Usage**
-----------------------

This option allows you to plot the viscosity, which is written to the *Output EXODUS II*
file as the variable **MU**. This is a useful feature for non-Newtonian fluids such as
Phillipâ€™s model for suspensions, Bingham plastic models, polymerizing solutions and
other materials for which the viscosity may change orders of magnitude, greatly
affecting the velocity and pressure fields. Contouring this variable **MU** over the domain
can be useful in explaining some physical phenomena.

he permissible values for this postprocessing option are:

======== ===============================================
**yes**  Calculate the viscosity and output as a nodal 
         variable in the Output EXODUS II file.
**no**   Do not calculate the viscosity.
======== ===============================================

**Examples**

The following sample card requests **MU** be written to the EXODUS II file:
::

   Viscosity = yes

**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

See the material file *Viscosity* card for an explanation of the models for which the
viscosity is variable and dependent on the flow field and other variables.
