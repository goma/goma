-----------------------
**Description / Usage**
-----------------------

Each *PARTICLE* card represents a separate particle trajectory. As many of these cards
as desired can be input to direct *Goma* to compute a particle trajectory.

There are eleven values to specify in the <float_list>; definitions of the input
parameters are as follows:

============== ======================================================================
<float1>       **xpt**, the X-coordinate of the origin of the trajectory.
<float2>       **ypt**, the Y-coordinate of the origin of the trajectory.
<float3>       **zpt**, the Z-coordinate of the origin of the trajectory.
<float4>       **initial_time**, the start time for computing the trajectory (a
               value in units consistent with rest of the problem, i.e. length
               scale/velocity scale).
<float5>       **end_time**, the end time for computing the trajectory. The
               trajectory will be computed until the end time is reached or
               until the particle trajectory leaves the computational domain.
<float6>       **point_spacing**, the desired distance between successive
               points on the trajectory. The point spacing may be decreased
               below this value if required by the trajectory calculation but
               it will not exceed it.
<float7>       **mobility**, the mobility of the particle when particles with
               inertia are desired. Enter zero for inertia-less trajectories.
<float8>       **mass**, the mass of the particle. If the trajectory of an inertialess
               particle is desired, a value of 0.0 should be entered.
<float9>       **force_x**, the X-component of an external force (such as
               gravity) which is to be applied to the particle (with mass).
<float10>      **force_y**, the Y-component of an external force (such as
               gravity) which is to be applied to the particle (with mass).
<float11>      **force_z**, the Z-component of an external force (such as
               gravity) which is to be applied to the particle (with mass).
<file_name>    A character string corresponding to a file name into which
               the output should be printed.
============== ======================================================================

Thus, the particle trajectory starts at the coordinates defined by **xpt, ypt,** and **zpt**. The
trajectory of the particle is computed starting at a time value of **initial_time** and
continuing until **end_time** is reached or until the particle exits the computational
domain. The time step is adjusted so that the distance between successive points on the
trajectory is, at most, equal to the **point_spacing** (it may be less if the time-stepping
algorithm requires it). At each point along the trajectory, the *usr_ptracking* routine is
called which the user may modify to control the output to **file_name**.

**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

The vorticity vector function, :math:`\underline\omega` , is defined in terms of the velocity :math:`\underline\upsilon` as:

.. figure:: /figures/337_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

Trapezoidal rule time integration is utilized with Euler prediction.

For trajectories with particle inertia (i.e. when the product of mass and mobility is
greater than zero), the following evolution equation is used:

.. figure:: /figures/338_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

where :math:`\omega` is the particle mobility (e.g. 1 ‚ÅÑ (:math:`6\pi\mu r`)  for a sphere of radius *r*
in a liquid of viscosity :math:`\mu` ), m is the particle mass, and **f** is the external force vector acting on the particle.

The trajectory is computed using a coupled set of ordinary differential equations:
