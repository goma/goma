**Description / Usage**
-----------------------

**(SIC/ROTATED MESH)**

This boundary condition allows the user to specify a constant contact angle along an
edge in three-dimensions. It is identical in function to *CA_EDGE_CURVE* boundary
condition, but applies as a strongly integrated constraint. The boundary condition is
applied to the edge curve defined by the intersection of the primary and secondary side
sets.

Definitions of the input parameters are as follows:

====================== ===============================================================
**CA_EDGE_CURVE_INT**  Name of the boundary condition.
**SS**                 Type of boundary condition (<bc_type>), where **SS**
                       denotes side set in the EXODUS II database.
<bc_id1>               The boundary flag identifier, an integer associated with
                       <bc_type> that identifies the boundary location (side set
                       in EXODUS II) in the problem domain. This identifies
                       the *primary side set*; in almost all cases it should also be
                       a free-surface.
<bc_id2>               The boundary flag identifier, an integer associated with
                       <bc_type> that identifies the boundary location (side set
                       in EXODUS II) in the problem domain. This identifies
                       the *secondary side set*. The outwards-pointing normal
                       vector to this side set is used as the *substrate* vector
                       when enforcing the contact angle constraint.
<float1>               the enforced contact angle, in degrees. Its value should
                       lie in the range 0 ≤ angle ≤ 180.

**Examples**
------------

The following is a sample input card:
::

     BC = CA_EDGE_CURVE_INT SS 40 50 135.0

This boundary condition will enforce a 135 degree angle between the normal to the free
surface on side set 40 and the outward-pointing normal to side set 50 at all points along
the edge defined by side set 40 and 50. The is no restriction on whether side set 50’s
normal vectors must be constant.

**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

* Although this boundary condition deals with vector quantities it is a scalar
  constraint. As noted above the form of the constraint is identical to that in the
  *CA_EDGE_CURVE* boundary. In this case, it is applied as a strong integrated
  constraint:

  .. figure:: /figures/061_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

  where φ\ :sub:`i` is the finite element trial function for node
  *i*, Γ is the edge space curve, n\ :sub:`f` is the outwardpointing
  normal to the primary sideset, n\ :sub:`s` is the
  outward-pointing normal to the secondary sideset,
  and θ is the angle supplied on the card. There is
  always some confusion regarding the sense of the
  angle. Use the figure to the right for guidance. Note
  that the sense depicted here is at odds with the
  usual contact angle convention. Keep this in mind
  when using this card.

    .. figure:: /figures/062_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

* As in the case of the *CA_EDGE_INT* condition, this condition is also a strongly
  integrated constraint.

  VAR_CA_EDGE, VAR_CA_USER*.
