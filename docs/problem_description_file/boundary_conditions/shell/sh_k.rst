**Description / Usage**
-----------------------

**(DC/shell_curvature)**

This Dirichlet boundary condition specification is used to set a curvature to the inextensible shell equations (see EQ = shell_tension and EQ = shell_curvature) at an endpoint. This boundary condition can be applied in two dimensions only, and only to the endpoint of a bar-type element:

========== ===============================================================
**SH_K**   Boundary condition name (<bc_name>) that defines the
           shell curvature.
**NS**     Type of boundary condition (<bc_type>), where **NS** denotes
           node set in the EXODUS II database. Note that this must be
           a single-node node set representing and endpoint to a bar
           element type.
<bc_id>    The boundary flag identifier, an integer associated with
           <bc_type> that identifies the boundary location (node set in
           EXODUS II) in the problem domain.
<float1>   Value of curvature.
[float2]   An optional parameter (that serves as a flag to the code for a
           Dirichlet boundary condition). If a value is present, and is
           not -1.0, the condition is applied as a residual equation.
           Otherwise, it is a "hard set" condition and is eliminated
           from the matrix. *The residual method must be used when
           this Dirichlet boundary condition is used as a parameter in
           automatic continuation sequences*.

**Examples**
------------

The following is a sample card for applying a Dirichlet condition on the curvature for a shell equation:
::

   BC = SH_K NS 100 0.

This condition sets a curvature of zero at Nodeset 100.
