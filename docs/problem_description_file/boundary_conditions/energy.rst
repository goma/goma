Category 5: Energy Equations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following conditions are applied as boundary conditions to the energy equation. These
conditions include strong Dirichlet conditions, such as hard sets on temperature on a boundary as
a constant or function of position, weak-form conditions, such as a specified heat flux from a
convective heat transfer model or a constant flux, and a host of interfacial conditions for phase
change (viz. latent heat effects), etc. The energy equation is of course a scalar equation. Some with a molten metal surface. These conditions will also apply in general to the porous energy
equation (see Porous Energy).
highly specialized equations are also available, such as a heat flux model for a laser interaction
