Category 14: Fluid-Solid Interaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a special group of boundary conditions for problems in which there are two distinct
material phases (fluid and solid) with relative motion between them. These BCâ€™s provide a means
to apply conditions to a moving boundary with sensitivities to variables in both phases. These
problems are formulated in Goma as overset-grid or phase function problems.
