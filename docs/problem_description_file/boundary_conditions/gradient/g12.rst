**Description / Usage**
-----------------------

**(DC/GRADIENT12)**

This Dirichlet boundary condition specification is used to set a constant xy-velocity
gradient component of the velocity gradient tensor. Definitions of the input parameters
are as follows:

============ ====================================================================
**G12**      Boundary condition name (<bc_name>) that defines the xy-velocity
             gradient.
**NS**       Type of boundary condition (<bc_type>), where **NS** denotes
             node set in the EXODUS II database.
<bc_id>      The boundary flag identifier, an integer associated with
             <bc_type> that identifies the boundary location (node set in
             EXODUS II) in the problem domain.
<float1>     Value of xy-velocity gradient.
[float2]     An optional parameter (that serves as a flag to the code for a
             Dirichlet boundary condition). If a value is present, and is
             not -1.0, the condition is applied as a residual equation.
             Otherwise, it is a "hard set" condition and is eliminated
             from the matrix. *The residual method must be used when
             this Dirichlet boundary condition is used as a parameter in
             automatic continuation sequences*.

**Examples**
------------

Following is a sample card for applying a Dirichlet condition on the xy-velocity
gradient component on node set 100:
::

   BC = G12 NS 100   5.0

::

   BC = G12 NS 100   5.0   1.0

where the second example uses the “residual” method for applying the same Dirichlet
condition.

**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

We solve a simple least squares equation to determine the continuous velocity gradient
*G* from the velocity field. This is done so that we may have a differentiable field to get
estimates of the second derivative of the velocity field for applications in complex
rheology. The velocity gradient equation is:

.. figure:: /figures/178_goma_physics.png
	:align: center
	:width: 90%

Note, that boundary conditions are almost never set on the velocity gradient equation
since it is just a least squares interpolation of the discontinuous velocity gradient
derived from the velocity field.

See the Technical Discussion for the *UVW* velocity boundary condition for a discussion
of the two ways of applying Dirichlet boundary conditions. For details of the velocity
gradient tensor and its use for solving viscoelastic flow problems, please see Rao
(2000).
