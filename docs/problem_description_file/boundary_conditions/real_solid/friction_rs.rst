**Description / Usage**
-----------------------

**(WIC/VECTOR REAL SOLID)**

This boundary condition card applies a force per unit area (traction) on the
TOTAL_ALE solid mechanics equations. The force per unit area is applied according
to Coulombâ€™s friction law over the boundary delineated by the side set ID. The applied
traction is of course a vector. The vector traction is defined in normal-tangent vector
basis. Definitions of the input parameters are as follows:

================ ============================================================
**FRICTION_RS**  Name of the boundary condition (<bc_name>).
**SS**           Type of boundary condition (<bc_type>), where **SS**
                 denotes side set.
<bc_id>          The boundary flag identifier, or a side set number which
                 is an integer that identifies the boundary location (side
                 set in EXODUS II) in the problem domain.
<float1>         :math:`\mu`, Coulombic coefficient of friction.
[integer1]       optional specification of the element block id to which
                 this condition will be applied.
================ ============================================================

This card actually applies a traction that is then naturally integrated over the entire side
set of elements.

**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

**Important note**: this boundary condition can only be applied to *TOTAL_ALE* mesh
motion types (cf. *Mesh Motion* card). For other mesh motion types, refer to *FRICTION*.

This condition should be utilized in conjunction with a rotated condition such as
SPLINE_RS in order to apply a tangential force which is proportional to the normal
force;

where :math:`\mu` is the coefficient of friction and :math:`\underline{v}` is the velocity of the convected solid. Note
that the direction of the frictional force is determined by the velocity direction.
