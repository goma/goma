	Matrix Absolute Threshold = <float>

-----------------------
Description / Usage
-----------------------

This card is only available with the Trilinos library. It allows the user to specify a lower
bound for either a diagonal entry or a singular value. The exact meaning depends on the
kind of preconditioner used (scalar-based or block-based). The legal values are:

<float>
    **t,** a floating point number ( t â‰¥ 0.0 ) that specifies a minimum
    threshold value for diagonal or singular value.

Along with the *Matrix Relative Threshold* card, this card gives the user the ability to
modify what matrix the preconditioner operates on. See the *Matrix Relative Threshold*
card for a full description.

If this card is omitted, the default is 0.0.

Examples

A sample input card follows:
::

	Matrix Absolute Threshold = 1.e-4

**Technical Discussion**
-------------------------

Refer to the discussion for card *Matrix Relative Threshold*. The appropriate values for
the threshold can vary over many orders of magnitude depending on the situation.
Refer to Schunk, et. al., 2002 for information and for further guidance.
