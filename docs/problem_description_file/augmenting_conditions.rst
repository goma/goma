Augmenting Conditions Specifications
########################################

Input records in this section are used to direct the solution of augmenting constraints on the base
system of differential equations. Addition of these conditions may require some programming in
the file user_ac.c. This entire section of the input deck is optional.

Input specifications for this section of input records is discussed in a separate, comprehensive
manual (Gates, et. al., 2000); an update to this manual has been completed during the summer of
2006 (Labreche, et. al., 2006).
