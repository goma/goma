Post Processing Particle Traces
###################################

This option enables the calculation of particle trajectories and computed quantities along the
trajectories. The coordinates of the trajectory starting point and time-stepping parameters are
input using the cards in this section. The computation of quantities along the trajectories and their
subsequent output is controlled through the *usr_ptracking* routine in user_post.c.
