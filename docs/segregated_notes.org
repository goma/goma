* General structure changes

Started by Kris, a global pg->imtrx was added that contains what
current matrix the problem is in

upd->Total_Num_Matrices was also added to keep track of the global
number of matrices

Kris also added matrix indices to many things in upd and pd:

upd->Total_Num_EQ
upd->Total_Num_Var
upd->vp
upd->ep

pd->Matrix_Activity
pd->e
pd->v
pd->Num_EQ
pd->w
pd->i
pd->m
pd->etm

Kris also changed many other global variables such as Dolphin to have
matrix indices

After Kris's changes Weston added a few more

Changed ei to include a matrix index e.g. ei[pg->imtrx] as ei is used
for loading field variables

Added two helper variables to the problem description structure

pd->mi which contains a matrix index for a given variable

e.g. pd->mi[VELOCITY1] would give the matrix that has VELOCITY1 active
or -1 if no matrix had VELOCITY1

and pd->gv which is a flag whether or not a variable is on in any
matrix (this was for simpler use in residual contributions in assemble
routines)

Additional changes were made to some boundary condition global
variables to have matrix indices to overcome issues arrising from
segregation


* Assemble routines that appear to be working

The routines that appear to be working (and their subroutines) are:

assemble_mesh
assemble_momentum
assemble_continuity
assemble_stress_fortin

We only tested on ALE problems.
