\title{Changes/additions to GOMA since last manual update}
\author{GOMA Authors}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

% Changelog for GOMA.  If you add a new capability to GOMA, or significantly
% change any existing feature, please quickly describe the changes below.  
% Update this document and check it into the repository with your changes, 
% so there will be a running documentation of new features after the GOMA 5.0
% manual.  This is a LaTeX document, so unless you're familiar with LaTeX 
% formatting, keep your documentation to plain text.


The purpose of this file is to provide a place to quickly catalog new capabililities in GOMA for which user-documentation is required.  As of Spring 2011, the goma user manual is in Framemaker and very difficult to access and change and rebuild.    Eventually everything in this file will get added to the user manual.  This file provides developers a place to quickly describe their new capabilties and add the beginnings of a doc page for each.   Several examples are provided. 

Some rules are in order:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Please identify yourself and the date you changed this file. I know we can extract this info from the svn logs, but it is nice to have it here too. (see examples)
  \item Please don't make major re-arrangements of this file because we like to be able to decipher the svn diffs. 
  \item Please add a syntax line for the input or mat files.   This will make it easy to reconstruct when we migrate this into more permanent documentation. 
  \item Above all, please add your new changes!!! Even if it is terse because you don't have time.   
\end{enumerate}

Finally, NOTE that we have provided several categories for changes.   Specifically, 1) Configuration Management, 2) Goma Input File capabilities, 3) Goma Material file Capabilities and 4) Overall Capability.    Feel free to add more categories.

\section{Goma Input File Capabilities}
\begin{alltt}


ADDED TO MANUAL 12/2/2012:
Capability: Transient restarts.  
Developer: Unknown  Date: Unknown
Description: A negative restart time will trigger goma to look for the
  nearest restart time value in an exodus file
Example:    Initial Time = -10.0  (see Initial time card).   
  In this example the restart exoII file is searched for the time
  closest to -10.0. 

ADDED TO MANUAL 12/2/2012:
Capability: Transient external field data
Developers: smdavis, prschun  Date: 3/1/2011
Brief Description: A "time_dependent" flag will bring in the nodal variable  
  interpolated to the current time step.   This can be useful in doing 
  transient coupling in problems like advection-diffusion. 
Example Cards: External Field = BEN_1 Q1 infile.exoII timedependent  
  See External Field card description.  The ``timedependent'' modifier
  which is optional triggers this field to be read in time from the
  exodus file infile.exoII and goma calls for the time plan closest to
  its actualy time plane.  

Capability: BC = F_DIODE_BC    Talk to randy Schunk or Scott Roberts.

Capability: Modification to GD_TIME to allow setting a maximum time
Developer: W. Ortiz
Description: User specified max time is used in place of current
solution time in order to allow a value to ramp up to a fixed
value. The max time parameter is optional.
Example:
BC = GD_LINEAR SS 1 R_MOMENTUM1 0 VELOCITY1 0 {web_speed/time_max} 0.
BC = GD_TIME   SS 1 R_MOMENTUM1 0 LINEAR 0 0 1. {time_max}
BC = GD_LINEAR SS 1 R_MOMENTUM1 0 VELOCITY1 0 0. -1.

Capability: Post processing global and printing of level set points
Developer: W. Ortiz
Description: Added a new Post Processing Global section to post
processing to allow for file output post processing. The global post
processing runs at each print so that it follows printing frequency.

Printing of LS interface to text datafiles. Uses reconstruction method
(Points or Facets) to print out appropriate points representing the
level set interface.

Two options LEVEL_SET_INTERFACE_PRINT prints the interface at the last
time step and takes a file name for input and overwrites file at every
step; and LEVEL_SET_INTERFACE_PRINT_ALL_TIMES prints interface at
every time step, including the time in the output and appending to the
filename.

Allows for easier data processing of interface position, such as for
plotting.

Example:
Post Processing Global =
GLOBAL = LEVEL_SET_INTERFACE_PRINT interface.dat
GLOBAL = LEVEL_SET_INTERFACE_PRINT_ALL_TIMES interface_all.dat
END OF GLOBAL

File formats:
- LEVEL_SET_INTERFACE_PRINT (tab separated)

x_coord y_coord point_indicator

- LEVEL_SET_INTERFACE_PRINT_ALL_TIMES (tab separated)

time x_coord y_coord point_indicator

Where point_indicator is 0 always if data is for point reconstruction,
and is 0, 1 for point pairs making up facet lines for facet
reconstruction.


Capability: Boundary condition for hydrostatic pressure
Developer: D. Hariprasad, December 2014
Description: Specifies pressure as P = P_0 + rho*g*x where rho is a variable density and the user specifies P_0.
Example:  BC = FLOW_PRESSURE_VAR NS 1 0

Capability: Galerkin least-squares continuity stabilization 
Developer: D. Hariprasad, February 2015
Description: Adds a Galerkin least-squares stabilization term using the residual of the continuity equation for incompressible or steady-state compressible flows.  This should help with high Reynolds number flow.  Similar to the Pressure Stabilization already implemented in Goma.  See Franca and Hughes 1988 for an abstract discussion of the method or Forster, Wall, and Ramm 2010 for a Navier-Stokes based discussion of the method.  The choice of a local or global stability parameter is left to the user.
Example: Continuity Stabilization = local


Capability:  Two-dimensional structural shell equations (extension of the one-dimensional shell implemented in Goma)
Developer: Kristianto Tjiptowidjojo, June 2014

Capability:  Mapping stress from initial guess to log-conformation
tensor (see "Log-conformation formulation for viscoelastic flows" under
"Goma Material File Capabilities")
Developers: Richard Martin and Weston Ortiz
Date: 5/3/2018
Description:  This input card is used with the log-conformation
tensor (with Polymer Constitutive Equation = \{OLDROYDB | GIESEKUS | PTT\} and
Polymer Stress Formulation = LOG_CONF in the material file). It is included with
the card "Conformation Map = \{yes|no\}" right after the Initial Guess
card and lets Goma know if the stress it's reading in is the regular polymer stress
or the log-conformation tensor stress. When it reads in the regular polymer
stress, you need to set "Conformation Map = yes". If the stress is already
read in as the log-conformation tensor, set "Conformation Map = no".
Example:
General Specifications
Initial Guess = read_exoII_file initial_guess.exoII
Conformation Map = yes

Capability:  Post processing of log-conformation tensor (see
"Log-conformation formulation for viscoelastic flows" under
"Goma Material File Capabilities")
Developers: Richard Martin and Weston Ortiz
Date: 5/3/2018
Description:  This input card is used with the log-conformation
tensor (with Polymer Constitutive Equation = \{OLDROYDB | GIESEKUS | PTT\} and
Polymer Stress Formulation = LOG_CONF in the material file). It includes a post
processing capability for the log-conformation tensor. The stress (S11, S12, and
so forth) that Goma outputs is the log-conformation stress. To map it to the
regular polymer stress, you need to set "Map Log-Conf Stress = yes" in the post-
processing cards. The regular polymer stress will then be included in the output
file as MS11, MS12, and so forth.
Example:
Post Processing Specifications
Map Log-Conf Stress = yes

Capability: Moving plane boundary condition due to etch reaction at surface
Developer: Kristianto Tjiptowidjojo
Date: February 20, 2019

Example:
        BC = MOVING_PLANE_ETCH SS 53 100

Capability: Species flux boundary condition due to etch reaction at surface
Developer: Kristianto Tjiptowidjojo
Date: February 20, 2019
Description: It is species flux condition at surface
             Right now, it is hardwired to CGS unit.

Developer: Randy Schunk  Date: 5/20/2011
Description:  LEVEL_SET model allows for this property to be changed
  from one phase to another, with the phase being marked
  with a level-set 0. 
Example: Electrical Conductivity	= LEVEL_SET  0.1 .0943 0

Capability: POLY_TIME lubrication height function model.
Developer:  Scott Roberts  Date:  7/18/2011
Description:  Allows an arbitrary-order polynomial (in time) as the height function 
  model for the upper height function in lubrication problems.  Called through 
  the material file card
Upper Height Function Constants = POLY_TIME c_0 c_1 c_2 c_3 ...
  where the c_i is the constant in front of the t^i term.  

ADDED PRS (12/17/2012)
Capability:  TANGENTIAL_ROTATE lubrication velocity model
Developer:  sarober  Date:  8/9/2011
Description:  Allows the unique specification of tangential motion in a lubrication 
  shell element.  Previous implementations allowed specification only in terms of 
  coordinate directions, but this can be used to rotate a cylinder.
Example:
  Lower Velocity Function Constants = TANGENTIAL_ROTATE {tx} {ty} {tz} {U1} {U2}
  The t vector must never be normal to the shell.  It is then projected onto the 
  shell, and the U1 velocity is specified in a direction that is the cross product 
  between the shell normal and the t vector.  The U2 velocity is then specified in a 
  direction that is normal to that first velocity.

ADDED PRS (12/17/2012)
Capability:  JOURNAL bearing lubrication height function model.
Developer:  sarober  Date:  8/9/2011
Description:  Allows the height function to simulate a journal bearing.  It is only 
  tested for the case where you are rotating a cylinder that is aligned with the 
  z coordinate and is centered at (0,0).  The parameters are the mean gap thickness 
  and the eccentricity.  
Example:
  Upper Height Function Constants = JOURNAL {Hlub} {ecc}

Capability:  POISSON_RATIO for LAME LAMBDA
Developers:  sarober  Date:  10/07/2011
Description: If you have a complex model for your Lame mu coefficient already, why repeat 
  it for lambda?  \(\lambda=2\mu\nu/(1-2\nu)\)
Example:  Lame LAMBDA = POISSON_RATIO 0.3

ADDED PRS (12/18/2012)
Capability: ADD TREF reference to BOUSSINESQ and BOUSS models 

Capability:  Lame Temperature Shift = {CONSTANT | POWER_LAW | TABLE}
Developers: prschun  Date: 4/10/2012
Description: Applieds a temperature shift fact to LAME Mu models (right now hardwired to only work with the Lame Mu = TABLE option).   When you use the Lame Mu = TABLE card you must supply the card
	Lame Temperature Shift = CONSTANT {flt}
or
        Lame Temperature Shift = POWER_LAW {Troom} {Tmelt} {exponent}
Example: Lame Temperature Shift = POWER_LAW 25. 550. 0.94

Description: New model for the Lower velocity function card which allows a general time-polynomial.   The first constant is a time-scale factor which can be used to scale the time, and the remainder are the coefficients of the polynomial in time starting from the constant term.  
Example: 
Lower Velocity Function Constants = SLIDER_POLY_TIME   {time_scale = 1000.} {-1.0*100.0*44.170122} {100.*361.41971} {-100.*807.45844} {100*256.08906}  {-100.*35.316517} {100.*2.1560711} {-100.*0.030632551} {-100.*0.0013365347}

ADDED PRS (12/21/2012)
Capability: Upper Velocity Function Card CIRCLE_MELT
Developers: Scott A. Roberts, sarober Date: 03/20/2012
Description: New model for the upper velocity function card which allows a converging or diverging height that is like a circle.  Also works with melting.  First coefficient is the x location of the circle center, second coefficient is the radius, and the third is the minimum height. 
Example: 
Upper Velocity Function Constants = CIRCLE_MELT {x_0=5} {r=1} {hmin=0.001}  

Capability:  Faux plasticity model
Developers:  Scott A. Roberts, sarober, Date:  4/10/2012
Description:  Short of using a full EVP model, it may be possible to ``fake'' plasticity by lowering the lame coefficients once the strain gets into the plastic regime, according to the stress-strain curve of the material.  This new capability allows the user to input the stress-strain curve, and the Lame mu will be calculated from the von Mises stress and strain, applied to the stress strain curve.  Also, must use Poisson Ratio as the model for Lame Lambda so everything is consistent.
Example:
Lame MU       = TABLE 2 FAUX_PLASTIC 0 LINEAR FILE=stress_strain.txt
Lame LAMBDA   = POISSON_RATIO 0.33

ADDED TO MANUAL PRS (12/21/2012)
Capability:  LOWER_DISTANCE model for Lower Height Function Model
Developers:  Scott A. Roberts, sarober
Date:  May 2, 2012
Description:  Allow user to specify an arbitrary lower height function model via a TABLE read that is translated in the x direction with the lower velocity function model.  Requires use of the SLIDER_POLY_TIME lower velocity function model.
Example:
Lower Height Function Constants   = TABLE 2 LOWER_DISTANCE 0 LINEAR FILE=shell.dat
Contents of shell.dat is a table with 2 columns.  The first is a position, the second is a height.

Capability: Log-conformation formulation for viscoelastic flows
Date: 5/3/2018
Developers: Richard Martin, Weston Ortiz
Description:  Uses an alternate formulation for the Oldroyd-B, Giesekus,
and PTT polymer constitutive models, using the log-conformation tensor. It
is included as "Polymer Stress Formulation = LOG_CONF" underneath
the Polymer Constitutive Equation card in the material file. The
stress tensor that it outputs (S11, S12, S22, and so forth) is the log-conformation
tensor, not the regular polymer stress. Two input cards can be included in the
input deck: "Conformation Map = \{yes|no\}", and "Map Log-Conf Stress = \{yes|no\}".
The Conformation Map is included after the Initial Guess card, and
lets Goma know if the stress in the initial guess file is the regular polymer stress
(hence, "Conformation Map = yes"), or if the stress is read in as
the log-conformation tensor ("Conformation Map = no"). In post
processing, "Map Log-Conf Stress = yes" will output the regular polymer stress
as MS11, MS12, and so forth. The log-conformation formulation works for multimode
constitutive equations and 2-dimensional cases (does not work in 3D). See "Mapping
stress from initial guess to log-conformation tensor" and "Post processing of
log-conformation tensor" under "Goma Input File Capabilities" for more
information.
Example:
Polymer Constitutive Equation = \{OLDROYDB | GIESEKUS | PTT\}
Polymer Stress Formulation = LOG_CONF
Polymer Weight Function = SUPG

Capability:  Enable phase fields with shell elements and in parallel.
Developer: Randy Schunk, Aug 2012
Brief description: Phase field was not compatible with parallel
processing (dp_vif, brk/fix, etc.).    Fixed this.   Also enabled
phase field to be used with thin shell lubrication with R_LUBP_2
equation)

ADDED TO MANUAL PRS (12/22/2012). 
Capability: True shell element capability.   
Developer(s): prschun, sarober, tjipdowi, hkmoffa.  Date: 2009-2011
Brief Description.  3D shells you must use a SHELL4 or SHELL9 element type in exodus.   
  Many shell equations added now. Seperate user-manual exists for this.  

ADDED TO MANUAL PRS (12/22/2012)
Capability: Time-dependent exodus II input:   
Developer(s): smdavis, prschun.  Date: 3/1/2011
Brief Description: We have the ability now to bring in transient field data to drive a 
  calculation.   That is, if the external field variable is flagged appropriately, then 
  that information is brought in at every selected time step and interpolated to best 
  match the given time step size.   

ADDED TO MANUAL PRS (12/22/2012)
Capability: Pixel-to-image-to-mesh capability.
Developer(s): prschun, esecor, tjipdowi, sarober Date:8/9/2011
Brief Description:  We can now read in through external fields a pixel map in the format 
  no. pixel points
  x_1 y_1 z_1 value
  x_2 y_2 z_2 value
  ...
  x_N y_n z_n value

ADDED TO MANUAL PRS (12/22/2012)
External Pixel Field = {variable name} {Q1|Q2} pixel.txt {blockid}
With this capability one can read in a pixel field generated from any drawing tool or 
  any image (in this format) and map it onto the mesh for a variety of uses as an 
  external field variable.  More to come.

Developer(s):  Scott A. Roberts, sarober  Date:  4/12/2012
Brief Description:  Calculates the maximum von Mises strain that has been experienced
at any given material point.  This was designed to be used for FAUX_PLASTICITY, and will
soon be required for its use.
Example:  
EQ = max_strain       Q1 MAX_STRAIN    Q1 1               1

Capability: Documentation and testing of element quality specifications
(rd_elem_quality_specs in mm_input.c)

Description: These capabilities are used to ouput and possibly deploy in solution
control of element quality during free and moving boundary ALE calculations.  They have
really never been used, but the idea wass for adaptivity.  
The issue here is that there use is NOT documented.    Should they be?  Or should they be
deprecated.   The cards are:
Jacobian quality weight= yes | TRUE
Volume change quality weight=
Angle quality weight=
Triangle quality weight=
Element quality tolerance type=
