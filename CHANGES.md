    - Works for Momentum and Mesh
    - Does not work for TANGENT or EDGE BCs, or if ROT cards are used
- Quadratic tetrahedrons (TET10 in Cubit)
- Partial PETSc support for matrix solvers
    - Can be used with a `petscrc` or `-petsc "petsc options"` on the command line
    - See manual `Solution Algorithm` for more information

    - Population balance equations using Moments (see Ortiz et al. 2022 AIChE)
    - Time-Harmonic Maxwell Equations with Lagrange Finite Elements and a penalty stabilization
- Adaptive meshing using `Omega_h` library for first order simplices
    - Requires first order Tet or Tri
    - Currently mostly used for level set problems see `Level Set Adapt` cards
    - ALE adaptivity of uniform ("iso") mesh size, see `ALE Adapt` cards
    - Currently limited to single materials
    - Nodesets and Sidesets must contain the same geometry and have the same number
- Brk/Fix support has been removed
    - Now compatible with SEACAS tools using elemental decomposition
    - epu from SEACAS replaces fix
    - brkfiles are no longer supported
    - See SEACAS decomp / `nem_slice`, `nem_spread` for more controlled decomposition
    - Automatic fix is still included, Fix Frequency is still available though not recommended
    - New output format is compatible with Paraview without `fix`ing
    - Automatic basic decomposition is available when configured with METIS
        - See cards `Decomposition Type`, `External Decomposition`
        - Command line flags `-e`, `-external_decomp`, `-kway`, `-rcb`
        - Defaults to `rcb` when less than 8 processors and `kway` when 8 or more
- Various bug fixes and feature updates, see merged Pull Requests
- SUPG formulation for Viscoelastic `EVSS_F`/`LOG_CONF` and Species has been modified
