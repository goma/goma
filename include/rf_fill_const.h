/*
 * Revision history:
 *
 * $Log: not supported by cvs2svn $
 * Revision 5.0  2006/07/06 16:18:54  edwilke
 *
 * New Goma version: 'Farewell CRMPR, hello $3 a gallon gas!'
 *
 * Revision 4.1  2003/11/25 23:16:00  dalabre
 * The copyright statement has been updated for Goma and the version ratcheted
 * to 4.4.0.
 *
 * The makefile Goma.mk has been updated for Linux and Sun so that these
 * versions can be built easily (until the configure-make production is
 * complete); the Linux version is default.
 *
 * Added a prototype for function assemble_interface_extension_velocity_sic
 * in mm_fill_terms.h.
 *
 * Revision 4.0  2001/12/21 06:01:41  dalabre
 * Up Goma source code repository to V4.0. This identification 'coincides'
 * with our documentation upgrade. It will be tagged "Tora_Bora" in
 * recognition of the deep, unknown recesses that still remain in Goma.
 *
 * Revision 3.4  1999/12/09 15:27:09  pasacki
 * Function prototype cleanup, removal of unused variables, initialize some.
 *
 * Revision 3.3  1999/11/16 15:50:23  hkmoffa
 * Chemkin-Goma merger checkin.
 * This passed the FULL test suite last night, except for the single problem
 * that Duane pointed out had NaN's on. It also passed my test suite which
 * actually checks the goma answer against a blessed solution file.
 * That test suite has two mp problems in it, as well as 2 chemkin
 * problems.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.3  1999/11/03 22:44:28  hkmoffa
 * Import of goma src from engsci
 *
 * Revision 3.2  1999/10/20 15:09:40  pasacki
 * Centralized prototypes for rd_{mesh,exo,dpi}.c
 *
 * Revision 3.1  1999/08/10 20:49:44  tabaer
 * Installation of VBR sparse matrix format
 *
 * Revision 3.0  1999/01/07 06:14:33  dalabre
 * The IMPEACHMENT Version.
 *
 * Revision 2.9  1998/11/17 11:47:42  pasacki
 * More code clean-up. Note new include files!
 *
 * Revision 2.8  1998/03/17 18:12:56  rrrao
 * forgot another! Sorry Phil.
 *
 * Revision 2.7  1998/03/05 21:57:29  pasacki
 * o Fixed up bugs in distributed processing modules.
 * o Minor cosmetic fix of ex_opts in mm_post_proc.c eliminates warnings of
 *   nonexistent element order map.
 * o New logic in mm_bc.c diverts duplicate BC listing to a file if
 *   threshhold criteria are exceeded (too many nodesets, sidesets or BCs).
 *
 * Revision 2.6  1998/01/15 00:03:47  prschun
 * Some more odds-and-ends.  Bug fixes to modified newton.  OSF1...
 *
 * Revision 2.5  1997/09/19 05:40:15  pasacki
 * Prelude to PUMBAA. Significant EXODUS II and other changes.
 *
 * Revision 2.4  1997/09/02 19:03:40  dalabre
 * This is the second round of PROTOtype updates to Goma, primarily in files
 * el_*.*, md_*.c and rf_*.*; other changes are companion changes needed for
 * compatibility.
 *
 * Revision 2.3  1997/07/17 22:54:59  rrrao
 * Fill eqn for q1 elements
 * Suspension model changes
 * Probably more...
 *
 * Revision 2.2  1997/05/14 20:33:06  rrrao
 * added variable interpolation for fill equation
 *
 * Revision 2.1  1996/12/13 23:11:12  rrrao
 * added second sparse matrix for vof stuff.
 *
 * Revision 2.0  1996/09/30 22:03:07  prschun
 * FY97-REVISION 2.0
 *
 * Revision 1.11  1996/09/27 22:35:35  prschun
 * Hold on, I must commit all of this files to get rid of salsa.h
 *
 * Revision 1.10  1995/08/01  19:01:26  racairn
 * Improvements in mesh motion scheme - nonlinear arbitrary mesh motion
 * separates shear (mu) and dilational (lambda) components; now mu and lambda
 * correspond to the shear and bulk moduli.  Also sub-parametric mapping
 * appears to work.  New porous media stuff. . .
 *
 * Revision 1.9  1995/06/05  22:02:39  rrrao
 * minor-time bug fixes to velo_tangent ...
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1995/06/02  16:11:50  racairn
 * Further changes in implementation of boundary conditions - the main goal
 * here was to standardize the bookkeeping for the bc's and make it easier
 * to add bc's or update the methods used for the old bc's
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1995/04/13  23:07:28  prschun
 * Main addition here is the USER option for the property model (previously
 * all taken as CONSTANT) has been activated for several properties.
 * The general dependency of mat props on all dependent variables necessitated
 * some significant changes to the core volume assemble_ routines.
 * Other misc changes, bug fixes etc. include:
 * 	-Storage format for d_mat_prop arrays of the mp struct.
 * 	   (removed MAX_CONC subscript)
 * 	-Added a BOUSS model option on the Navier-Stokes Source card
 * 	  for the Boussinesq model. (Thermal and solutal buoyancy)
 * 	-Added new .c file called mm_std_models.c  which currently holds
 * 	  just the boussinesq model.  All other standard models should be
 * 	  placed there.
 * 	-Fixed bug in parse_parameter routine.
 * 	-Added some more error checking in mm_bc.c
 *
 * Revision 1.6  1995/03/07  21:46:40  pasacki
 * (o) created LOG2_term indeces to replace all those ilog2() calls
 * (o) extended most vector dimension loops to VIM(=3) as aid to
 *     collecting reqd terms in nonCartesian coordinates
 * (o) added Harwell MA28 linear solver option (cf Makefile and sl_ma28.c)
 * (o) checked port back to SunOS 4.1.3
 * (o) eliminated various unused routines (eg, heat_conduct_with_mesh)
 * (o) generic orthogonal curvilinear coordinates (note scale factors in
 *     fv structure, bulk integrals, but *not* in boundary conditions)
 * (o) better insulation for fixed grid problems (fixed many UMR's)
 * (o) made a default "point to a zero" for unused esp entries
 * (o) used PROTO to help make code palatable to strict K&R compilers
 * (o) added more test problems
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1995/02/22  22:22:07  racairn
 * Added pressure datum, convected lagrangian, and maybe some other stuff too?
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1995/01/26  22:49:37  racairn
 * I was starting this update because I thought we needed to fix a Mysterious
 * problem in the Dip coater (with unmovable free surface) apparently you shouldn't
 * run these types of problems (transient movable free surface) on the IBM.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1994/12/22  22:04:10  racairn
 * This is a 'purified' version of GOMA with boundary conditions separated
 * into four separate functions (the first step in cleaning up this section).
 * Also, this version includes lagrangian mesh motion using linear or
 * nonlinear constitutive equations.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/11/22  16:54:49  racairn
 * This version includes equations for mass transport of multiple chemical
 * species and dirichlet and flux boundary conditions. RAC 11/22/94
 * Also some new post processing option
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  1994/05/24  19:56:33  pasacki
 * initial checkin
 *
