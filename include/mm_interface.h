/*
 *  Interface_Source Structure
 * ------------------------------
 *
 *        This structure is used to communicate with routines that
 *  calculate and track complicated interfacial source terms. The
 *  variables that each source term needs are model specific.
 *  However, several principles are generic. 
 *        The source term need only be calculated once for each 
 *  quadrature point. The results of the calculation may be used
 *  on one side of the interface after it has been calculated and
 *  used on the other side of the interface.
 *        The contents of the state variables are carried through 
 *  from one nonlinear iteration to the next and from one time
 *  step to the next. Thus, they may contain state information for
 *  the interface such as the total excess mass and excess species
 *  arial concentrations at the interface. They can also evolve
 *  with time.
 *        Each Interface_Source structure should only be set up
 *  once for each quadrature point on a surface. At that setup time,
 *  the Var_List vector is set up and thereafter not changed or
 *  freed.
