Mechanical Properties and Constitutive Equations
####################################################

This section of the material property input specifies the type of model, for both solids and fluids,
that relates stress and strain (or strain-rate) as well as the various parameters for these models.
Models for solids are relatively simple compared to solid mechanics codes but cover the primary
needs in fluid-solid problems. The models for fluids are quite extensive, covering Newtonian,
generalized-Newtonian, rate-dependent models, thermally-dependent models, curing and particleladen
models and combinations of these. These properties are used in the solid and fluid
momentum conservation equations.
