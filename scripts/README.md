# Goma dependencies build scripts

Before building Goma, a number of packages and libraries must be available.

* OpenMPI
* CMake
* HDF5
* MatIO
* NetCDF
* ARPACK
* BLAS
* LAPACK
* ParMETIS
* Sparse
* SuperLU_DIST
* Y12M
* ScaLAPACK
* MUMPS
* SuiteSparse
* Trilinos w/SEACAS

An example build script is available at `build-goma-dependencies.sh`

Dependencies for these scripts are:

* gcc
* g++
* gfortran
* m4
* zlib library
* libX11 library             

# Additional Requirements

## Environment Variables
OpenMPI should be added to the path and library path:

    export PATH="/[path to gomalibs]/openmpi-4.1.1/bin:$PATH"

SEACAS tools from Trilinos (e.g. aprepro and blot) should be added to
your path

    export PATH="/[path to gomalibs]/trilinos-13.0.1/bin:$PATH"  

An example configuration for bash will be written to

    [path to gomalibs]/config.sh

One should be able to build goma with (assuming a bash like shell):

	source [path to gomalibs]/config.sh
	cmake -B build-goma [path to goma src]
	make -C build-goma

See [BUILD.md](../BUILD.md) for more build options

## Example dependencies for common operating systems:

The build-goma-dependencies.sh script relies on several packages readily available in many repositories.

For Ubuntu this will install the necessary packages to run the script:

`sudo apt-get install git build-essential m4 zlib1g-dev libx11-dev gfortran pkg-config autoconf`

For CentOS / Fedora

`sudo [yum|dnf] install git patch gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran m4 make wget bzip2 tar zlib-devel libX11-devel pkgconfig`

## Goma Dependencies build script usage

Name

	build-goma-dependencies.sh

Synopsis

	build-goma-dependencies.sh -jN [library install path]

Description

	This script attemps to download, compile and organize all the
	dependencies of goma.  They are downloaded into [library
	install path]/tars and extracted into [library install path].
	No attempt is made by the script to place any file outside of
	[library install path].

	The minumum requirements for this process to succeed are:
	    
	    - gcc
	    - gcc-g++
	    - gcc-gfortran
	    - m4
	    - zlib
	    - libX11

	A command such as 'yum install gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran m4
	zlib-static libX11-devel' would ensure these packages are
	available on an enterprise linux distribution (e.g. CentOS,
	Redhat, Fedora, etc.).

Options

        -jN  N : Number of make jobs to run.
                 Several packages do not possess sufficient Make
                 configurations to run in parallel, so these are made
                 with one make job.

	Skip build questions by running with USE_RECOMMENDED=1 environment variable
	Example:

		USE_RECOMMENDED=1 ./build-goma-dependencies.sh -j4 ~/goma_tpls
